FITNESS OF THE WEAK APP

It's an app based on the Solo Leveling system, with nothing of that overwhelming "Defeat the boss with pushups!" or "Get to 50 winstreak to receive a reward!" stuff that the other similar apps have. It should be more personal to you instead of feeling mass produced and bloated. It should also have penalties that you actually don't want to receive instead of just being "Oh no, oops, missed a day ðŸ¤“". Remember, the only thing that is truly yours in this world is your body, so make sure to take care of it.

CURRENT TODOS:

- Add a way to progress on the current quest exercises, and have a way to complete the exercise so no penalties are applied.

- Make the clock tick for each hour of the day, also make the color change from light blue to red as it gets close to the time limit.

- After completing the app, it should start with the basic daily training from Solo Leveling as the current quest.

- Make it prettier and more accurate to the system of Solo Leveling.

- Have the purple version that you can activate in the settings (Because it's purple and really cool).

COMPLETED TODOS:

- Make the fitness for the weak quest.

- Add bottom navigation bar with three tabs, one on the left for the questhub (A place where you can CRUD the quests), a middle tab for the CURRENT quest, and one on the right for the profile where there should be the player's stats like body weight, height, fat porcentage and body sizings (Of course all taken professionally), as well as settings.

- Make the Questhub, and add CRUD actions.

- Have AsyncStorage.

END GOAL:

- Have some way of checking that the exercises are actually being done instead of being cheated.

- Have actually significant penalties, like blocking tiktok and twitter for a week (dont know if thats possible).

- Maybe have a way to connect to the GymRats app, maybe allow you to share the quest that you completed along with the confirmation that you actually did it (exercises done etc..).

- Periodically send notifications to your phone reminding you of the quest, and the consequences if not completed (It should have a robotic tone to it).
