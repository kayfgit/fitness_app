CURRENT TODOS:

- make the clock tick for each hour of the day, also make the color change from light blue to red as it gets close to the time limit

- be able to edit the goals so that players can make A or B or C days (just like push days or pull days in the gym)

END GOAL:

- have some way of checking that the exercises are actually being done instead of being cheated
- have actually significant motivating penalties, like blocking tiktok and instagram for a week or (dont know if thats possible)
