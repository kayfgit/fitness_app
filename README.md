# FITNESS OF THE WEAK APP

It's an app based on the Solo Leveling system, with nothing of that "Defeat the boss with pushups!" or "Get to 50 winstreak to receive a reward!" stuff that the other similar apps have. It should be more personal to you instead of feeling mass produced and bloated. It should also have penalties that you actually don't want to receive instead of just being "Oh no, oops, missed a day 🤓".

### Remember, the only thing that is truly yours in this world is your body, so make sure to take care of it.

## CURRENT TODOS:

- Add some test penalties

- Make the penalties work when you fail the quest

- Fix the stats screen

- Add notification settings

- Make it so there is a hidden achievement that allows you to get the purple theme. Write something like "You need to push beyond your limits to get a different theme"

- Make it prettier and more accurate to the system of Solo Leveling.

- Notifications and warnings should have the theme of the app.

- Change the Clock SVG and make the arrow tick for each hour of the day

## COMPLETED TODOS:

- Make the fitness for the weak quest.

- If the person doubles the amount of exercises of the courage of the weak quest, then the player gets rewarded with the purple version of the system.

- Add bottom navigation bar with three tabs, one on the left for the questhub (A place where you can CRUD the quests), a middle tab for the CURRENT quest, and one on the right for the profile where there should be the player's stats like body weight, height, fat porcentage and body sizings (Of course all taken professionally), as well as settings.

- Make the Questhub, and add CRUD actions.

- Have AsyncStorage.

- Make the profile tab, along with base look of the finished tab.

- Make the color change from green to red as it gets close to the time limit.

- Add a way to progress on the current quest exercises.

- Have a way to complete the quest so no penalties are applied.

- Have the purple version that you can activate in the settings (Because it's purple and really cool).

## END TODOS:

- Have some way of checking that the exercises are actually being done instead of being cheated.

- Have actually significant penalties that the player can select in the settings, like blocking tiktok and twitter for a week (Don't know if thats possible).

- Maybe have a way to connect to the GymRats app and allow you to share the quest that you completed along with the confirmation that you actually did it (Exercises done etc..).

- Make it completely bug-free

- Periodically send notifications to your phone reminding you of the quest, and the consequences if not completed (It should have a robotic tone to it).

- When you start up the app for the first time, have a window saying something like "You have acquired the courage to change, will you become a Player?". If you accept then the app opens, if not the app closes and uninstalls itself 😂

- After completing the app, it should start with the basic daily training from Solo Leveling as the current quest.

## KNOWN BUGS OR ISSUES:

- When you go to profile and press multiple times on the stats tab, it will redirect you a bunch of times, so you would need to press on the back arrow a bunch of times to go back, a fix would probably be to add a small delay to each press.

- Quest daily reset isn't working properly

- The X hitbox to uncomplete the quest is so unbelievably small
