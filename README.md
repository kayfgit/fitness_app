CURRENT TODOS:

- add a navigation bar on the bottom, it should have three tabs, the "questhub" in the left, where the quests can be edited and selected, the current quest on the middle, where it show the current quest and its progress, and profile on the right, where users can check their stats like weight, fat porcentage and body sizings and settings.

- make the clock tick for each hour of the day, also make the color change from light blue to red as it gets close to the time limit

- be able to edit the quests so that players can make A or B or C days (just like push days or pull days in the gym)

END GOAL:

- have some way of checking that the exercises are actually being done instead of being cheated
- have actually significant penalties, like blocking tiktok and twitter for a week (dont know if thats possible)
